You: How to sort in python?
Quoco: 

Python offers a number of ways to sort items in lists or other collections. The most common way to sort lists is with the built-in sorted() function. You can also use the list.sort() method, or you can use the built-in sorted() function.
The sorted() function takes an iterable and returns a new sorted list from that iterable. It has two optional arguments: reverse and key. The reverse argument is a boolean value; if set to True, the list is sorted in descending order. The key argument is a function that will be applied to each element before making comparisons.
For example, to sort a list of numbers in ascending order, you could use the following code:

my_list = [3, 4, 1, 5, 2]

sorted_list = sorted(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

To sort a list of strings in descending order, you could use the following code:

str_list = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy']

sorted_str_list = sorted(str_list, reverse=True)  # ['howdy', 'hello', 'hi']
```
